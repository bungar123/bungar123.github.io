  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Collaborated with faculty to develop a graduate-level course focused on diagnosing and handling missing data in
    applied business analytics. I contributed to course design, built a realistic synthetic dataset with thousands of
    records and inter-variable dependencies, supported missingness simulation and imputation workflows (including MICE),
    and helped establish a model-based evaluation framework so students could compare approaches using objective metrics.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    <p style="margin-top:0;">
      <strong>Highlight:</strong> I contributed to building and piloting this graduate course while I was a full-time
      undergraduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    In real analytics work, missing data is unavoidable. If missingness is not diagnosed and handled correctly, it can
    introduce bias, reduce model performance, and lead to incorrect business decisions. The goal of the course was to
    teach students a practical workflow: diagnose missingness, clean data, apply appropriate imputation methods, and
    evaluate downstream model performance.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>What I Did</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reviewed and refined a course data dictionary by identifying variables, data types, and logical dependencies
      between features (how A affects B, B affects C, etc.), helping inform the course’s structure and learning flow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built a synthetic dataset (10–15k records) representing season ticket holder behavior, including realistic
      dependencies across variables (e.g., ticket type linked to income, household structure, tenure, and account type).
    </li>
    <li>
      Supported course design in R by developing and refining a structured course outline and instructional materials
      (e.g., an RMarkdown “master” file with lessons, code examples, and exercises).
    </li>
    <li>
      Helped implement missingness experiments (simulating missing data) and guided students through imputation methods
      ranging from simple single imputation (mean/mode) to multiple imputation using <code>mice</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated a model-based evaluation approach where students compared imputation strategies by training predictive
      models and measuring accuracy against known ground-truth values (e.g., using RMSE).
    </li>
    <li>
      Helped define a consistent scoring framework to compare student solutions and identify best-performing approaches
      relative to a reference (“parent”) benchmark.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Course Workflow (What Students Practiced)</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <ol style="margin-left:18px;">
      <li><strong>Understand the data</strong> → data dictionary, variable types, dependencies</li>
      <li><strong>Clean the data</strong> → fix typos, inconsistent categories, and data quality issues</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnose missingness</strong> → patterns, mechanisms, and practical implications</li>
      <li><strong>Impute</strong> → single imputation (mean/mode) and multiple imputation (MICE)</li>
      <li><strong>Model & evaluate</strong> → train models and compare results with objective metrics (e.g., RMSE)</li>
      <li><strong>Select a final approach</strong> → choose the best-performing workflow and justify it clearly</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Example Modeling Context</h2>
  <p>
    A core course use case was predicting whether a season ticket holder would renew (churn vs. retain) using the
    available features. Students learned how imputation choices affected model performance and how to defend their
    chosen approach with evidence.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helped launch and refine a graduate-level course that students responded to positively during an initial pilot.</li>
    <li>Created realistic instructional data and workflows that mirrored real-world missing data challenges.</li>
    <li>Established a repeatable framework for evaluating imputation methods through downstream predictive performance.</li>
    <li>Contributed to ongoing improvements through iterative refinement across semesters.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Curriculum development and instructional design for graduate analytics topics</li>
    <li>Data dictionary refinement and feature dependency thinking</li>
    <li>Synthetic data generation with realistic business logic and dependencies</li>
    <li>Missing data diagnostics and multiple imputation (MICE) in R</li>
    <li>Data cleaning and quality assurance for modeling readiness</li>
    <li>Model evaluation and benchmarking (e.g., RMSE) to compare approaches objectively</li>
    <li>Communicating technical concepts in a student-friendly, applied format</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Code Availability Note</h2>
  <div class="note">
    <p style="margin-top:0;">
      The instructional code developed for this course is currently in a probationary and
      evolving state as the curriculum continues to be refined. Because the material is part
      of University of Tennessee coursework and has not yet reached a finalized release,
      code snippets and full examples cannot be publicly shared at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the course continues to mature and permissions are granted, representative code
      examples and instructional artifacts may be published in the future.
    </p>
  </div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Data Note</h2>
  <div class="note">
    <p style="margin-top:0;">
      The dataset used for instruction was <strong>synthetic (fully simulated)</strong> for educational purposes and does not contain
      real customer or team data.
